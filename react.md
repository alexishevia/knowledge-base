VIM + JSX
----------------------------
I'm using the vim-polyglot plugin, which includes vim-jsx.
By default, JSX syntax highlighting and indenting will be enabled only for files with the .jsx extension. If you would like JSX in .js files, add to your project .vimrc:
```
let g:jsx_ext_required = 0
```
