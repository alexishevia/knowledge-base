alexishevia's personal knowledge base

This is a collection of stuff I've found useful during my software development career.
- Most info is collected as I learn/work on some new technology (language, framework, library, etc).
- If I continue working on that technology, I'll keep revisiting the document and adding new tricks I've learned along the way.
- If I don't continue working on that technology, the content will most likely become stale (check the `last modified` timestamp on files).

## Development
This knowledge base is written with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org).

You can run it locally with:
```
npm i docsify-cli -g
docsify serve .
```
