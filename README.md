alexishevia's personal knowledge base

This is a collection of stuff I've found useful during my engineering career.
- Most info is collected as I learn/work on some new technology (language, framework, library, etc).
- If I continue working on that technology, I'll inevitably forget stuff and will be forced to revisit the document. At that point the document will be updated with new tricks I've learned along the way.
- If I don't continue working on that technology, the content will most likely become stale.

## Table of Contents
- [Cron](./cron/) - the unix time-based job scheduler

## Development
This knowledge base is written with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org).

You can run it locally with:
```
npm i docsify-cli -g
docsify serve .
```
